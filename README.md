# Python project: Data anonymization

Created 13.11.2024

Topic of the project is data anonymization. The main goal will be to create synthetic data and evaluate it numerically and visually. In this project, I would like to create a full workflow in Python for this problem. 

I will use data from the Answers to the Machivallianism Test from https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/
